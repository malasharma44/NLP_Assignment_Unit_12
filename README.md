# Unit 12â€”Tales from the Crypto: NLP analysis, Bitcoin and Ethereum

## Background

For this assignment I have used natural language processing to analyze sentiment in news articles featuring Bitcoin and Ethereum. Using fundamental NLP techniques I have looked at other factors involved with the coin prices such as the words and phrases used frequently, as well as the names of the entities mentioned in the articles.

### 1 - Sentiment Analysis

I utilized the [newsapi](https://newsapi.org/) in order to access news articles for Bitcoin & Ethereum. I have created a DataFrame of sentiment scores for both Ethereum and Bitcoin.

> Q. Which coin had the highest mean positive score?
> A. Bitcoin had the marginally higher mean positive score.

> Q. Which coin had the highest negative score?
> A. Bitcoin and Ethereum had very similiar negative mean scores, however Ethereum had a slightly higher negative max score.
> 
> Q. Which coin had the highest positive score?
> A. Ethereum had the higher positive max score.
> 
> Q. Which coin had the highest compound score?
> A. Bitcoin had the higher compound mean score, but Ethereum had the higher compound max score.

### 2 - Natural Language Processing

NLTK & Python were used to tokenize text, find n-gram counts, and create word clouds for both coins. 

#### Tokenize

For tokenization, the process has been to:

1. Lowercase each word.
2. Remove punctuation.
3. Remove stop words.

#### N-grams

I analyzed the ngrams & word frequency for both Ethereum & Bitcoin.
The process involved the following:

1. Use NLTK to produce the ngrams for N = 2.
2. List the top 10 words for each coin.

#### Word Clouds

For visual representation of the findings, I generated word clouds for both coins to summarize the news accordingly.

### 3 - Named Entity Recognition

I created a named entity recognition model for both coins using SpaCy.
